		I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science at Tufts University. This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at IBM as a software developer where I developed a responsive and mobile-first login page. I also worked at MIT Lincoln Labs last year researching for DARPA's CRASH Project. I am based in the Boston area and if you would like to contact me, feel free to email me!
