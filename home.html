		I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science at <a href="www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>. This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at <a hfref="www.ibm.com">IBM</a> as a software developer where I developed a responsive and mobile-first login page. I also worked at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Labs</a> last year researching for DARPA's CRASH Project. I am based in the Boston area and if you would like to contact me, feel free to email me!
