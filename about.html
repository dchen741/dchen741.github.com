<h3 id="aboutSpacing"> 
	I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science at <a href="www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>.
	This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM </a> as a software developer where I
		developed a responsive and mobile-first login page.
	I also worked at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Labs</a> last year researching for DARPA's CRASH Project.
	I am based in the Boston area and if you would like to contact me, feel free to <a href="mailto:Dennis.Chen@tufts.com">email me</a>!
