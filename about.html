		In addition to school, I have had the pleasure of working with several different companies. This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>  as a software developer where I developed a responsive and mobile-first login page. I also worked at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Labs</a> last year researching for DARPA's CRASH Project.
