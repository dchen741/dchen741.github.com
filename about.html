		<p>Hi there! I'm Dennis and...</p> 
		<p>I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science at <a href="www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>. I have taken many classes including, but not limited to, Data Structures, Algorithms, Networks and Computer Security. In addition to school, I have had the pleasure of working with several different companies. This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>  as a software developer where I developed a responsive and mobile-first login page. I also worked at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Labs</a> last year researching for DARPA's CRASH Project. I am based in the Boston area and if you would like to contact me, feel free to <a href="mailto:Dennis.Chen@tufts.com">email me</a>!</p>
